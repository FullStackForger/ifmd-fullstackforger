# What Independent Game Development is and is not

## What indie development IS NOT

Before you move on, lets get one thing straight!
Indie game development is NOT "development only". If you are an indie (independent) developer (in most cases) you are NOT working for someone else. That means few things. 

Firstly and most importantly, paycheck is NOT coming. Secondly, you are NOT paid to do development only. Lastly and most imporantly, if you don't make money you are NOT going to survive.
All of above means means, you are NOT excused from other activities - your life and career depdens on those.

Assuming you are actually thinking seriously of being fulltime independent game developer, **monetizing your game is critical** part. And to do that you need marketing.

If, however, you making games just for fun and satisfaction and don't care about the money part, you can as well go away right now and draw yourself a beautiful rainbow or better, a unicorn for your new game.

## What indie development IS?

Are you still here? Ok. Let's move on. 
We have already established that being indie stands for independent and means doing more than just coding. Those are:

- **Development**: creating your game functionality.
- **Art & design**: creating graphical assets for your game (drawing, modeling, texturing, designing, ux).
- **Sound design**: creating sound effects and music, balancing them together (mastering).
- **Level design & balancing**: making sure levels are well designed, playable and fun.
- **Testing**: making sure game is bug free, UI and payments work as expected, game doesn't crash, new functionality doesn't break old features.
- **Project management**: keeping eye on deadlines, coordinating activities to meat deadlines, estimations, budgeting
- **Release management**: releasing the game to target platforms, dealing with potential issues
- **Distribution**: simply put: monetising the game, salesmanship.
- **Marketing**: telling the world about the game.

All of those activities can then be split into many separate sub-categories but we won't go down to those details. All you have to know right now is **there is a lot to do**.

This isn't main focus of this article but let's go back to "why" question for just a minute.

## Working with people or working alone

There are many examples of successful one-man independent studios. It is possible. Just remember that if you want to survive, grow and thrive as a one-man studio you will either have to master all of the aspects of indie game development or hire people to help you with that.

Alternative is to find to find a person or even better persons who can fill those gaps. Building the team takes time. It takes even more time to build good team. It is, however, well worth it. Why? 

## Why working in team is better than working alone?

- worload is split between people,
- as a team you can do more in less time,
- it takes less time to complete the game,
- you have more time to focus what you do best,
- working with others is more fun,
- it is easier to stay focused,
- it is easier to stay motivated,
- and more...

you get the point, don't you?

GOOD LUCK!

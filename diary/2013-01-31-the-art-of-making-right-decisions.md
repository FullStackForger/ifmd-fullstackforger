# The art of making right decisions – stay calm and take it easy

Just couple days ago my good friend posted on her Facebook wall a interesting quote:
> It’s easier to stay awake till 6am, that to wake up at 6am.

I was deeply moved. Damn right it is, isn't it! Why is that though?

Have you ever felt like you are in a wrong place or wrong time? Have you ever miss your last train and had to figure your way back home? Have you found yourself distracted and disturbed while doing something? Have you pushed yourself for hours in the wrong direction? Have you been confused about life? Have you ever spent few hours in bed trying to stop a waterfall of thoughts, hoping to sleep just to finally realize that it is not going to happened anyway. Have you been confused about your relationship, not knowing if you should get married or split? Does any of those sound familiar?

Hold on but what are we aiming at here?

Well… Let's suppose it is fine to stay up the whole night once in a blue moon. From time to time, it’s fine to take 6 hours walk home because last train is gone. It is alright to have bad day every now and then, be confused or lost in life for few days.

However, if most of the time you think to yourself something like "oh no, why again?" or are depressed and mixed up on daily basis you, well...  
You might want to take a weekend off or perhaps dedicate short holiday (being on your) to actually answer "why again" question.

As kids we ask "why" at least few times every minute, like little "why" machineguns. We do ask less "why"-s while growing up but and as we enter adulthood this number drastically reduces.

Oh yes, of course – we talk to family, friends and speak with clients. We do because they are important people. And yes, we are interested in them or we want to know why an invoice is not paid, why they were late for school, why dishes are not done and dinner not ready, why they forgotten to do something and why are they confused about something.

How often do you talk to yourself though? How often do you ask yourself "why" questions? Think about it and then think how often you actually take time to genuinely answer them.

Failure is part of life – we all should know about it by now. If you disagree, you are a fool. We fail very often. We try to sit up – we can’t. We try to speak – no one understands. We try to walk – we fall. We try to draw – not even straight line. We try to write for years, sing, graduate, pass tests and exams, get a job, earn money, plan holidays, have kids, buy a house or run a business. Are you getting the point?

We always fail and it is fine because eventually we stand up and try harder, again and again until what we get what we want. And that’s the way to go.

Understanding the problem helps. Knowing what stops us from making another step forward allows to overtake the blocker and move on and eventually sleep better at night.

But what would I know, and why should you listen?

I have no diplomas, no degrees and writing about asking questions as a gold remedy. Firstly, I am not trying to tell you what to do. I just suggest you take time to find out. Best person that knows and understand your situation, that can answer questions and make decisions is YOU.

But what I can tell you for a fact is, in order to find those answers you should have calm mind and try to be objective. You might seek advice from others, friends, family or perhaps therapist but the end decision is always yours. I have been there myself so many times that, trust me, I know exactly what I am talking about. With anger bursting through my chest, the tears pouring off my face, out of breath, obsessed with work, confused about life, sleeping 3 – 4 hours every 2 – 3 days and feeling like screeming, every time something fails – I know exactly what I am talking about. 3 years ago I was different person and I never want to be that person again. I am not saying my life is perfect. I am not saying all my issues are gone. However, I was lucky enough to realize that because of lack of balance and lack of plan I was going nowhere.

I heard recently from someone much younger than me (but much more educated) that I should meditate before trying to answer any important life question. I don’t really do meditation, at least not in a exact way sense. On the other hand, I do understand why it is helpful. In order to make the right decision and not regret it in the future you have no choice but to calm down and push away emotions. I would suggest that you try different methods and activities to find way that suits you best. Here are few that work for me.

## Breathing / meditation

I have done some marshal arts in the past and I think have forgotten most of it by now. Not breathing exercise though. I did a lot of it before each training session. It always helped to stop thinking about everyday duties or problems so I could focus just on fighting techniques. These days I use the same exercise to calm down while being disturbed. It is not problem solver but method that helps to think rationally and make decisions without emotions.

## Planning

I wasn’t able to sleep the other night. After 2 hours of constantly battling my own thoughts I decided to come downstairs and switched on PC. Couldn’t decide what to do at first. My head was full of thoughts and I was angry with myself past few days because couldn’t accomplish tight deadline in my current project. I was also little disturbed because of idea of relocating to India ( another long story). I spent few hours in open source LibreOffice Draw application drawing "Plan of action" chart. After getting everything out of my head I laid down and slept peacefully.
Consensus? Plan! Planning helps to get things out of your head onto the paper.

## Talking / venting

Not long ago my  (ex)fiancee told me that after few years together she learned to stay calm while I am venting after work. As it often happens I tend to become really miserable every time I work for someone. Always angry, frustrated and disappointed in myself. After coming home she is the first person I talk to and obviously to get this whole frustration and disappointment out, complain and moan. It doesn’t last long but I just have to get all this emotions out. In the past it did caused unnecessary pressure but now it looks more like a funny 10 minutes stand up sketch, after which everything comes back to normal. It is important to find someone you can vent to and as important to realize when someone is venting to avoid random arguments.

## Shouting / screaming

Not often but it does happens that I am so extremely angry that I feel like my body is going to explode. If you have a partner or a job that makes you cry,  (change it) you probably know what I am talking about here. If you want to scream... scream! It does help. Try to not shout at other people, that certainly might be more harmful than helpful. Find a place where you can screaming/shout. There was a time I have almost lost my voice while driving - yes, I was alone in the car. Again… not a solution to a problem but helps to get the emotions out so you can find one.

## Writing

I do that a lot. Matter of fact always did. This post is an example of getting things out of my head. It doesn’t have to have a structure, message sometimes even sense. Doesn’t matter. Just do it – put it on the paper, blog or scribble on your bank statement if it helps. You will feel better. It might be good idea to write about stuff that disturbs you so you can go back to it when you are calmer.

## Balance

Lastly the most difficult – balancing your life. Read below speech and give it a minute to think about.

> Don’t just have career or academic goals. Set goals to give you a balanced, successful life. I use the word balanced before successful. Balanced means ensuring your health, relationships, mental peace are all in good order.
> There is no point of getting a promotion on the day of your breakup. There is no fun in driving a car if your back hurts. Shopping is not enjoyable if your mind is full of tensions.”Life is one of those races in nursery school where you have to run with a marble in a spoon kept in your mouth. If the marble falls, there is no point coming first.
> Same is with life where health and relationships are the marble. Your striving is only worth it if there is harmony in your life. Else, you may achieve the success, but this spark, this feeling of being excited and alive, will start to die...
> One thing about nurturing the spark – don’t take life seriously. Life is not meant to be taken seriously, as we are really temporary here. We are like a prepaid card with limited validity. If we are lucky, we may last another 50 years. And 50 years is just 2,500 weekends. Do we really need to get so worked up? ...
> It’s OK, bunk a few classes, scoring low in couple of papers, goof up a few interviews, take leave from work, fall in love. We are people, not programmed devices.

Does it mean be lazy, don’t rush, take it easy? It means whatever you want it to mean for you. If you are entrepreneur you probably know the cost of getting to where you are or can imagine the cost of getting to where you want to be. Just ask yourself a question: do you want to get there alone? If yes – there is nothing more to say – go and kill yourself on the way up. If not – take it easy. You have time. It will not make a difference if you make your first million year or two later. If you are a confused person caught up in the madness of life, slow down for few days. Give yourself time to ask questions and think. You might find that the answers and solutions are closer that you think they are. Without manic rush you will become calmer person who has time for your family, friends and most importantly yourself.

If you will ask questions and seek the answers, they will come – at least most of the time. *wink*

Good luck!

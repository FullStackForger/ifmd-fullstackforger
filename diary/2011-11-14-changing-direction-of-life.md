# Changing direction of life
<!-- todo: image from the movie -->
\- _David, in this shit life… we must chuck some things. We must chuck them!_
– says Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine) to his son David (Nicolas Cage) in one of
the scenes of "The Weather Man" movie.

You might want to see the whole movie to get an idea of “shit life”.

Now... even though I don’t consider my life a shitty life there is still
space for some improvement. Perhaps that is why those words hit me strong!

So here is what I am going to do...

## Invest in the future

I am back to PromoSquare venture which is not an idea anymore but a journey that
became part of my life. That is why those words got to me even more.
Last few years I spent as a Flash AS3 freelance developer.
It is something that comes easy but definitely it is not something what I intend
to do for the rest of my life.

What next then?

Giving up something being mastered for last few years doesn’t come easy but seems
to be the only way to switch to what is more important for the future.

It really seems to me like that sometimes it takes a lot to get somewhere
and additionally it often requires change of the direction.

Is it a pivot? Learning curve perhaps?

I have just read my post from January [How to fail… not][fail-not] and honestly...
the only things that haven’t change since then is the passion and the attitude.
Why don't I learn ...faster? But well... hey! Never give up!

## Follow the "Guide to Epiphany"
To get better start this time I looked into “The Four Steps to the Epiphany”
written by Steven Gary Blank. Going through chapters I kept asking myself if
one man business can do both Customer and Client development.
Most importantly how to apply of what I learned to my personal development,
which seems be as important as developing the business.

S.G. Blank states that completing first two steps: Customer Discovery
and Customer Validation corroborate business model.

> [..] Completing this two steps verifies your market, locates your customers,
tests the perceived value of your product, identifies economic buyer,
establishes your pricing and channel strategy, and checks out your sales cycle
and process.[..]
> \- chapter 2, page 21

I keep the book handy to make sure I can reach it at any given time.
I ask myself if I can accomplish all of it as a one man team.
Doesn’t seem I have a choice. Next question is: what will it take?
Took me about a week to realize that developing + studying AS3,
developing + studying PHP, JS and Linux administration
along with customer development and personal life on the top of it,
is not combination I am able to squeeze into 24/7 routine.

Certainly it is not the way to go.

## My Plan of Action (POA)

>\- ***David, chuck some things!***

1. **End of AS3 career** – AS3 was big part of my life recently. However duo
to changes on the market I decided to go with the flow (HTML5/JS).
2. **PHP focus** – PHP is my back-end choice for PromoSquare.
3. **English** – can’t really afford to spend whatever time and money I have left
to study it more than I am doing now (reading books and simply using it).
Someone told me once that business is not always about vocabulary or grammar
but providing quality service for those who need it.
4. **Customers** – I need to get more feedback. But how to get feedback on something
that is not yet built? I guess I will start with the phone and emails
 to get some answers to get discovery loop going.
5. **Team** – This is big "if". There is couple of guys I have in mind but with
no budget it might take time to find someone with right set of skills who
would get involved. Will go back to it later.
6. **Budget** – I am already running short. I already used up all my savings
during last attempt. One thing for sure is that I need to get an additional
resources to keep going. I would need either  an investor or to go back
to contracting.

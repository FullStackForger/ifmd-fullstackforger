# How to fail NOT

\- "Damn it!" – I have repeated again and again after had realized there is no way
to make this business work.  
\- Perhaps I should consider going permanent again? - I would but it simply
doesn't feel right. - Why I failed ...again?


That is kind of monologue I have been having with myself for a while now.
Eric Ries answered this question quite well on his blog.
Check his post titled [Achieving a failure](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/01/achieving-failure.html)

## Why it didn't work out again?

Why should it? The list of ‘whys’ is not a short one. Here is list of my mistakes.
That should hopefully help you (and me) to avoid some of them in your endeavour.
So why did I fail again?

- **Sacrificing all spare time and no breaks** drastically reduced my productiveness,
eventually causing burnout, which meant stopping the project due to general
exhaustion and total loss of enthusiasm.
- **Fear of someone stealing the idea** was the reason I had kept it secret.  
That meant developing a system in an isolation, in a _stealth mode_.  
Without showing it to anyone I couldn't get any feedback at all to confirm
I was pushing it in the right direction. Guess what, I WASN'T!
- **Involving QA persons early on** didn’t do any good but did some harm instead.
It consumed some of precious startup time and made me focusing on functional quality,
instead of delivering a prototype.
- **Assembling team from available instead out of SKILLED people** was wrong at many levels. Not only it took a lot of time to get everyone up to speed but caused additional
errors, mistakes, holdups. Qualified stuff is the key.
- **Little (or no) starting budget** meant no wages, meant we are just a bunch of
guys sharing ideas (and cakes) but not necessarily workload.
- **Unrealistic deadlines** were set and no deadlines were met.
- Persistence was good but **persisting bad execution** is just… stupid.
- Target was set but **lack of feedback and no pivot** made it totally irrelevant.

## You are not alone!

Chris Lunt posted a comment below Eric article. I decided to copy it here as no doubt it is one of the best comments I have ever read.

> My experience (3 time founder, 6 startups, 1 IPO, 5 colossal failures) is that we spend too much time looking for what we do wrong, when in fact, we may have done nothing wrong. My thought on the evolution of the entrepreneur:

>- **Green**: “The idea is what wins!”
>- **Tenderfoot** (1 failure): “OK, idea is fine, but you need the right team”
>- **Battered** (2 failures): “OK, the right team AND the right execution.”
>- **Hardened** (3 failures): “Well then, idea, team, execution and TIMING.”
>- **Wizened** (4 failures): “I think I got it: idea, team, execution, timing and funding terms” (this one really hurts, you think you succeeded, and then find out due to preferences you don’t actually get any money)
>- **Sagacious** (5 failures): “It’s luck! If you do everything right, you’ve got maybe a 25% chance”

## What went wrong?

Everything and... nothing as failure is just a lesson while climbing learning curve. Current one is quite steep! I lost around £30k and almost 6 months of time.
I keep repeating to myself learning business is like learning how to riding a bike. Sometimes we need to get hurt to learn.

Give me a shout if you had “interesting” startup experience yourself or you currently bootstraping something.

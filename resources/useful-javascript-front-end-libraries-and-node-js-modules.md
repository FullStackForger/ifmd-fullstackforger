# Useful JavaScript front-end and NodeJS modules

JavaScript libraries, frameworks and Node.js modules you will use will vary
from company to company and project to project.

Here is a list of modules, frameworks and resources I have been founding useful
throughout the course of my carrier.

## Front-end

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) – MVC framework for front-end development created by Google
- [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) – JavaScript library that helps you to  create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces  with a clean underlying data model,
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) – fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

## AMD and Loaders

- [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) – is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code,

## Test frameworks
- [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) – behavior-driven development MVVM framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - the fun, simple, flexible JavaScript test framework

## Node.js

- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) – Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node,
- [websocket.io](https://github.com/learnboost/websocket.io) –
abstraction of the websocket server previously used by Socket.IO. It has the broadest support for websocket protocol/specifications and an API that allows for interoperability with higher-level frameworks such as Engine, Socket.IO’s realtime core,
- [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node) – This node.js module makes the wonderful Pivotal Lab’s jasmine spec framework available in node.js,
- [angular-express-seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed) – it contains angular libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all
preconfigured for instant web development gratification,
- [karma](http://karma-runner.github.com/0.8/index.html) – Spectacular Test Runner for JavaScript,
- [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) – JavaScript task runner
- [Facebook-node-sdk](https://github.com/iEvaluation/facebook-node-sdk) – With facebook-node-sdk you can now easily write the same code and share between your server (nodejs) and the client (Facebook Javascript SDK).

## Databse packages
- [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) – elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js,

## Other complementary resources

- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) – Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development,

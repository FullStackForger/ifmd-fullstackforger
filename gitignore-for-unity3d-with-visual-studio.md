# .gitignore for Unity3d with Microsoft Visual Studio

Unity3d Team License will extend the Unity editor, adding features to make  team collaboration easy. It is however quite expensive if you getting started.

That is why I decided to go with GIT and BitBucket, which can hold infinite number of private repositories and is free up to 5 users.


## project setup

1. Start new unity project
2. Open terminal and naviage to unity directory
3. Create .gitignore file and paste below content
4. Initialize git repository with `git init`
5. Go to your Bitbucket or Github and create repository and follow instructions to add it to your local repository

## .gitignore

```
